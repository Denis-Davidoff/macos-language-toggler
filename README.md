## Why LanguageToggler?

macOS allows cycling through all installed keyboard layouts, but what if you have 3, 4, or more languages installed and only need to quickly switch between two of them?

**LanguageToggler solves this problem:**

- **Toggle mode**: Instantly switch between your two most-used languages with a single hotkey — no more cycling through all installed layouts
- **Direct access**: Jump to any specific language instantly with dedicated hotkeys
- **Visual feedback**: See the current language in a popup indicator

---

## Features

- **Two-language toggle** — Switch between two selected languages with one hotkey (e.g., English ↔ Russian)
- **Per-language hotkeys** — Assign a dedicated hotkey to any installed keyboard layout for instant switching
- **Visual indicator** — Optional popup shows the current language after switching
- **Menu bar app** — Runs quietly in the menu bar, no Dock icon
- **Launch at login** — Start automatically when you log in
- **Multilingual interface** — UI available in English, Russian, Ukrainian, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Turkish, Chinese, and Japanese
- **Lightweight** — Native macOS app, minimal resource usage
